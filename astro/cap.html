            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Capricorn is the tenth astrological sign in the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Capricornus. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area from approximately December 22 to January 19. Capricorn is represented by the Sea-Goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and tail of a fish.</p>
            
            <p>As a cardinal earth sign, Capricorn embodies ambition, discipline, and practicality. Those born under this sign are known for their determination, responsibility, and unwavering commitment to achieving their goals. Ruled by Saturn, the planet of structure and limitation, Capricorns possess a natural understanding of time, patience, and the rewards that come from hard work and perseverance.</p>

            <h2>Symbol and Mythology</h2>
            <h3>The Sea-Goat</h3>
            <p>The symbol of Capricorn is the Sea-Goat, a creature with the upper body of a goat and the lower body of a fish. This unique hybrid represents the duality of Capricorn's nature: the goat climbing steadily toward mountain peaks symbolizes ambition and the ability to overcome obstacles, while the fish tail represents emotional depth and the subconscious mind.</p>
            
            <h3>Mythological Origins</h3>
            <p>In Greek mythology, the Sea-Goat is associated with Pricus, the father of all sea-goats who was created by the god Chronos (time). According to legend, Pricus's children would venture onto land and become regular goats, losing their intelligence and ability to speak. Despite his attempts to turn back time and prevent this fate, Pricus could not stop the inevitable. In recognition of his wisdom and sacrifice, Chronos placed him among the stars as the constellation Capricornus.</p>
